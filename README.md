# Arduino Servo Engine Handler
* This code has been made for a remote controlled robot with servo engines.
* An IR receiver gets input through a remote controller.
* Received signal will be translated to rotation of the corresponding servo engines.
* The code contains: hardcoded hex values of IR signals, basic functions for rotation and some wrapper code to present high level functions of robot movements.
